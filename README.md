# Towards a public repository of designed proteins  💾🧬

## Overview 🌍
This project is part of the *"Projects in Bioinformatics"* course and focuses on creating a public-access database dedicated to computational protein designs.

### Phase 1: Problem Study and State of the Art; Solution Definition and Preliminary Validation; Interim Paper Writing 📄

In this phase, the goal is to deliver an interim paper which will include:

* Definition of the project’s objectives.

* State of the art in the project’s area, including:

    * A literature review,

    * Previous related works,

    * Analysis of relevant software.

* A preliminary analysis of the problem to be addressed, with a concise definition of the methodologies to be used and the project work plan.

#### Files in this Repository 📂

Interim Paper: This file contains the interim paper for **Phase 1**, which includes the project objectives, state of the art, preliminary problem analysis, methodology, and work plan. The paper is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the project’s initial steps and is limited to 6 pages (excluding references).

Conceptual Model: This file includes the conceptual model of the project, developed using MySQL Workbench. It outlines the database structure, relationships, and key components needed for the next stages of the project.
